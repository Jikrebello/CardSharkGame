            <p>
              Your quest, should you choose to accept it, is to create a
              <span class="tiny">teensy tiny</span> game. In the game you are
              presented with 2 cards, on the back of one is a treasure while the
              other has a bomb. You need to guess the correct one to win. When
              you win, you can ceremoniously show off the trophy 3d model
              (mesh).
            </p>
            <h2>How to split it up</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Please create the cards and the card selection as part of your
                UI (html) interface. The assets for the front and backs of the
                cards are in "/Textures/Card/", the selection buttons can be
                made any way you like.
              </li>
              <li>
                Please show the 3d trophy in the game engine. The model can be
                found at "Models/Trophy.glb", the texture can be found at
                "/Textures/Trophy.webp".
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Main objectives</h2>

              <li>Have a working game.</li>
              <li>
                Create a beautiful and responsive interface to select your
                answer.
              </li>
              <li>Randomize the position of the winning and losing cards.</li>
              <li>Create a cool sequence to reveal your selection.</li>
              <li>
                Create an on screen counter to show you how many correct guesses
                you have in a row.
              </li>
              <li>Show the celebratory trophy.</li>
              <li>
                Delete the "node_modules" folder, zip everything up and send it
                back to us.

            <h2>Side quests</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Add some sound.</li>
              <li>You can modify any textures if you'd like.</li>
              <li>
                You can look into the different texture types and apply them to
                the trophy.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can create a PBR material instead of standard material to
                make the trophy appear more realistic.
              </li>

              <li>
                Have a good read through game.ts, this is where the game engine
                gets initialized. Look especially at the comments as there are
                some useful example and debug functions. Remember that you can
                also still use console.log like you usually would in any js
                application.
              </li>
              <li>
                The main stylesheet is "ui.less", it also imports from
                "common.less". LESS looks almost identical to CSS, but has some
                special built-in features. Feel free to create more stylesheets
                if you need, but please have import them into ui.less
              </li>

                The trophy mesh has been specifically exported to not have a
                material yet, and you have to apply the texture to the material
                and the material to the mesh. Check out
                <a

                link to find out how to make materials and apply textures. We
                only supplied a diffuse texture. You don't have to worry about
                the different types of textures right now.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the texture on the trophy is looking warped or glitchy, when
                importing it try setting "InvertY" to false.
              </li>
            </ul>
